This is an interactive, animated web art piece made using the p5.js library.

There are several ways that you can interact with this piece:
- keys [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, -] play notes
- space bar switches user between different instrument modes
- left/right arrow keys move the ship to the left/right
- ship changes color on keypress
- clicking on a star will turn on/off a soundboard.

Additional audio/mobile acceleration input features:
- Phone shake makes the waves choppy with water sound, and the fish movement angles are also a bit steeper.
- Bubbles appear from the mouse position when there is audio input from the mic.

Multiple users can also play collaboratively on different browsers.
